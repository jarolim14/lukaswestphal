title: "Zotero Workflow"

# WIP
Throughout my academic work, I arrived at a workflow for reviewing literature that I really like. Here is a description. 

I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a reference manager.

My favorite reference manager! (Also [jabref](https://www.jabref.org/) is pretty good.) I strongly recommend using a free and open-source reference manager to keep your libraries accessible regardless of your subscriptions. Try not to use Mendeley or any other from big publishers. 

To create a first-sight categorization of your articles, you can assign them an emoji as a tag and then assign a color to this emoji (right-click on the tag in the bottom right corner). Now the emoji will always show in front of the title. For example, I use ⏳ to indicate an unread article. See below.
