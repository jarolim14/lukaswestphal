Hello World! 

I am a PhD Student in Copenhagen and just wanted to build a website to build a website. I picture it to be a repository that stores all the handy little apps, workflows, tricks and tricks that I use in my daily work. It might also turn into something where I write about things, my interests mainly lie within psychology, data science, and politics.
