# anxiety, ideals of beauty, hyper-individualism and medicalization

Initially created to treat patients with Type 2 Diabetes, the drug 'semaglutide' gained approval from the FDA to treat obesity and has since gotten a lot of attention. Elon Musk attributed his weight loss to the new drug called 'Wegovy' and Kim Kadashian is believed to have used the drug to lose 7kg in three weeks to fit into a dress that belonged to Marilyn Monroe. Today, the demand is so high, the producing pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk is unable to meet the demand even though the drug is only available in the US. On the one hand, it is a promising treatment option for obese patients, indicated for people with a BMI higher than 30. However, the great enthusiasm outside the patient population raises broader questions about weight, health, obesity, and society.

Whereas famous athletes and top models advertise high-caloric food, trying to transfer their image of health and success to these products, the natural consequence of their regular consumption is still frowned upon in society. In public media, shows like 'The Biggest Loser' depict obese people as lacking self-regulatory capacities and follow the folk rationale that obese people lack willpower and discipline, are unhygienic, and lazy. A phenomenon oftentimes described as fatphobia the 'the implicit and explicit bias of overweight individuals that is rooted in a sense of blame and presumed moral failing.'
In parallel, social media (Instagram, TicToc, Snapchat) bombard us with an ideal of beauty that emphasizes athleticism, slimness and skin free of impurities, which creates a false perception of the norm and is reflected not least in the available filters on these platforms.
Unsurprisingly, the paradoxical situation of living in a culture where high caloric fast-foods are cheap, readily available, and highly advertised that simultaneously pursues an unforgiving ideal of beauty and health, creates increased feelings of guilt and (bodily) dissatisfaction. Increases in cosmetic surgeries and hair transplants complete this picture.

However, this is not the first time that a prescription drug gains great popularity among the general population. Another prominent example can be seen in the widespread use of Adderall (a drug to treat ADHD) and similar stimulants for cognitive enhancement. People feel an increasing pressure to perform at a high level, of not doing/being enough, in a rapidly changing and competitive world. Increasing rates of depression and burnout indicate a broader cultural crisis that many individuals try to tackle through medicalization.

But what is the problem with slimmer bodies and smarter people? First, of course, the extent to which these drugs are a good means to sustainably achieve success and health is very doubtful. Many studies show that weight is a rather weak surrogate measure of overall health (and some extra kilos tend to be beneficial, e.g. when undergoing cancer treatment). Also whether drugs used for cognitive enhancement are effective for individuals whose abilities fall within a normal range is questionable. Adding frequent side effects of those stimulants such as insomnia, anxiety, and emotional numbness to the picture further impacts the benefit-risk balance.

Secondly, both approaches to tackling perceived inadequacies fall short on an important dimension. As I have shown, these phenomena have their origins in changing societal expectations. Where individuals are held responsible for their successes, they are for their failures as well. It is a hyper-individualized and superficial worldview that meets increasingly anxious individuals that envision a medical treatment of their problems as an attractive and quick fix to move closer to the chased ideal.

However, this representation of obesity and weight loss can be stigmatizing in several ways: (ytvideo)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD0IrZvKVQk] (ytvideo)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmtbL4j9_hw]
