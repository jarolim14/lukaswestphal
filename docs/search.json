    "text": "Pondering the Pervasive Power of Pharmaceuticals in the Pursuit of Perfection\nInitially created to treat patients with Type 2 Diabetes, the drug ‚Äòsemaglutide‚Äô gained approval from the FDA to treat obesity and has since gotten a lot of attention. Elon Musk attributed his weight loss to the new drug called ‚ÄòWegovy‚Äô and Kim Kadashian is believed to have used the drug to lose 16lb in three weeks to fit into a dress that belonged to Marilyn Monroe. Today, the producing company Novo Nordisk is unable to meet the demand even though the drug is only available in the US.\nOn the one hand, it is a promising treatment option for obese patients, however, the great enthusiasm outside the patient population raises broader questions about weight, health, obesity, and society.\nEvery day, we are targeted by advertisements that depict famous athletes or models eating high fat, high sugar, and high processed food.  \nThese people are symbols of beauty, fitness, success, and discipline and their association with these products is supposed to convey these attributes to the respective products. They might further work in countering negative perceptions of these products as being unhealthy. Because one thing is for certain - we do not want to be seen as obese, or even slightly overweighed. In public media, shows like ‚ÄòThe Biggest Loser‚Äô depict obese people as lacking self-regulatory capacities and follow the folk rationale that obese people lack willpower and discipline, are unhygienic, and lazy. A phenomenon oftentimes describes as fatphobia the ‚Äòthe implicit and explicit bias of overweight individuals that is rooted in a sense of blame and presumed moral failing.‚Äô In parallel, social media (Instagram, TicToc, Snapchat) bombard us with an ideal of beauty that emphasizes athleticism, slimness and skin free of impurities, which creates a false perception of the norm and is reflected not least in the available filters on these platforms. Unsurprisingly, the paradoxical situation of living in a culture where high caloric fast-foods are cheap, readily available, and highly advertised that simultaneously pursues an unforgiving ideal of beauty and health, creates increased feelings of guilt and (bodily) dissatisfaction.\nIt should come as no surprise that the drug is enthusiastically embraced by an overweight population that chases an unrealistic ideal and embraces individualized self-improvement doctrines.\nHowever, this is not the first time that a prescription drug gains great popularity among the general population. Adderall\nThis can lead to feelings of shame and inadequacy among those who do not fit this ideal, and can also contribute to the increased prescription of weight loss drugs. end with the big bang of a society where study drugs / cognitive enhancement if celebrated alongsided weightloss drugs. cosmetic surgeries, hair transplants, etc. touch upon adderall and SSRIs - the threshold is ever decreasing - medicalization of society?\nThe TV show ‚ÄúThe Biggest Loser‚Äù depicts obese people as needing to lose weight in order to be successful and happy. The show often emphasizes the physical transformation of the contestants as the primary measure of success and often uses before and after shots, weigh-ins, and other visual cues to highlight their weight loss.\nHowever, this representation of obesity and weight loss can be stigmatizing in several ways: (ytvideo)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD0IrZvKVQk] (ytvideo)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmtbL4j9_hw]\nIt reinforces the idea that obesity is a personal failure and that people who are obese are lazy and lack discipline.\nIt implies that weight loss is the only solution to obesity and that being thin is the only way to be happy and successful.\nIt can also be argued that the show's emphasis on rapid weight loss through extreme dieting and exercise can be dangerous and unsustainable, and can set unrealistic expectations for viewers.\nAdditionally, the show has been criticized for not addressing the underlying psychological and emotional factors that contribute to weight gain, and not providing a holistic approach to weight loss and health.\nindividual problem - individual solution\n\n\nCode\nco <- c(\"check\")"

I would try to refrain from using Mendeley since they are part of Elsevier, a big publisher with rather questionable business practices. Skimming its wikipedia already gives you an idea, this guardian article is a longer read but worth it.\nAlready the default Zotero application is pretty good, it is of course possible to install add-ons to your browser and Word to integrate it with your literature search and writing process. However, to get the most out of the program, some helpful settings and add-ons can be recommended."

To increase the overview I use some tweaks to the default settings.\n\nGo to view and check the ‚ÄòShow Items from Subcollections‚Äô option. If unsure in which subfolder you stored an article, you can now search for it in the main folder.\nIn the General Settings -> Miscellaneous, untick the box ‚ÄòAutomatically tag items with keywords and subject headings‚Äô. I find this clutters the tags which I frequently use to categorize my articles. I try to keep them clean.\nTo assign different attributes to some paper, I use emojis as tags and then assign a color to them. The way you do it is a) Click on a paper you have not read yet.

    "text": "Add-Ons\nAdd-ons are small programs that extend the functionality of Zotero widely. Here is a list\n\nZotfile for data storage: The free cloud-storage will be filled up rather quickly. However, if you want to work on your library from different computers, it can be really handy to have it stored in the cloud. The most convenient way is to upgrade your account, for $20 a year, you get 2GB of storage. See here for more info. I opted for a different solution and use a OneDrive folder to store my Zotero library. Setting up requires some steps:\n\nCreate a folder in a directory where you want your files to be stored.\nDownload and install theZotfile add-on.\nIn Zotero settings, go to Sync and uncheck Sync attachment files in My Library\nClick on Tool and open Zotfile preferences. The Source Folder for Attaching New Files should typically be your download folder1. Below, set the Location of Files to Custom Folder and select the folder you created in 1a. If you leave the Use subfolder defined by unchecked, all files will be stored in the folder you created in 1a. If you check it, you can specify subfolders based on e.g.¬†author, year, etc.\nHere is what I use:  And how it looks: \n\n\nIn Zotfile, Advanced Settings, check Remove special characters (diacritics) from filename.\nIn Zotero settings, go to Advanced > Files and Folders and set Linked Attachment Base Directory to the folder you created in 1a. Repeat this on every computer you want to access the files from.\nSet the renaming rules in the Zotfile preferences. I use the following: \nIn your My Library window, click the paper clip to sort on attachment column. Select all papers that have a file attached and right-click on them. Select Rename and Move. This will move and rename all files to the folder you specified in 1.a. You might want to store a safety copy of your Zotero library beforehand in case something goes wrong.\n\nNow, every newly created entry will automatically be stored in the specified way. Only when using drag and drop, it might not work and you have to manually selecet rename and move again.\nNote that if you delete an item now, you will have to delete the pdf by right-clicking on the item and select ‚ÄúShow File.‚Äù\nBetter BibTex is great for creating citation keys and for exporting. This is my citation key settings:  To export it as a .bib file, right-click on My Library and select Export Library. Select Better BibLaTex, uncheck abbreviated journal articles and check keep updated. I usually store this file in the directory where I am writing my paper.\n\nOther useful add-ons:\n\nNight for Zotero: I use this to change the color scheme of Zotero.\nInciteful Zotero Plugin: This can help with finding new papers that are similar to a selected one.\nZotero OCR: This Zotero plugin adds Optical Character Recognition to Zotero. So you will always be able to search for / highlight text in your PDFs.\nZutilo: An add on that is not so important to my workflow, but sometimes it is handy to copy paste multiple tags.\n\nA last nice thing to know is that you can drag and drop multiple files into Zotero and it will very accurately create the reference. You can also select multiple items and drag them to a tag in the bottom left corner to assign them all the same tag."
